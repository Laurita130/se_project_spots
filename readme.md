# Spots Project

In this project  I had to make a responsive profile and card
layout designed for both desktop and mobile views with smooth transitions.
It uses HTML for structure, CSS and Flexbox and Grid for alignment. I incorporate 
media queries to adjust the layout on different screen sizes.The profile and card sections are style to adapt seamlessly to mobile and desktop.I tried to make sure that this design was clean and modern.
